# gtcodes
putting everything done that is related to game theory
there will be things from class but mostly from web
there will be some tweaks from code found on web as well as some try outs

all files will be redone so code is sorted in proper classes, in proper .h/.cpp files

//note 2.11
optmove will most likely be redone as i don't like the way it deals with some cases

//note 13.11
ai for tic tac toe is not the perfect one but it works good
not all cases are yet tested
it will be updated to give option for human multiplayer, as well as ai multiplayer
there have been some small tweaks for a few files

//note 15.11
everything expect tic tac toe code is sorted into .h/.cpp files
